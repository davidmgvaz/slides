# The thesis

<div class="mt-12 mx-auto text-center text-2xl font-bold opacity-90">

Django's conventions earn their keep<br/>
because they come with <em>escape hatches</em>.

</div>

and recognising when one doesn't exist yet.

  hatch (a sanctioned deviation) or a hack (because no hatch existed yet).

# Models — `AbstractUser` & `AUTH_USER_MODEL`

The textbook escape hatch. **Don't extend `auth.User` — swap it.**

```python
# accounts/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class User(AbstractUser):
    company = models.ForeignKey("Company", null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    email   = models.EmailField(unique=True)
```

```python
# settings.py
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.User"
```

<v-clicks>

- `AbstractUser` for "I want the defaults + a few fields"
- `AbstractBaseUser` for "I want full control of the auth fields too"
- `get_user_model()` everywhere — never `from django.contrib.auth.models import User`

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-4 text-sm opacity-70">
Shipped in Django 1.5 (2013). We'll come back to what we did before this existed.
</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:30

# ORM — custom Managers & QuerySets

The ORM ships a hatch most teams never open. `QuerySet.as_manager()`:

```python
class QuestionQuerySet(models.QuerySet):
    def published(self):
        return self.filter(pub_date__lte=timezone.now())
    def with_choice_count(self):
        return self.annotate(num_choices=Count("choice"))

class Question(models.Model):
    text     = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField()
    objects  = QuestionQuerySet.as_manager()

# Both work — chainable, composable, single source of truth for "published"
Question.objects.published().with_choice_count()
Question.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2026).published()
```

<div class="mt-4 opacity-80">
Encapsulates domain queries in the model. Replaces 90% of the helper functions
that drift across views and shell scripts.
</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:15
- Optional aside: "if you see `Question.objects.filter(pub_date__lte=...)` in
  three views, that's a `.published()` waiting to happen."
- If asked: `models.Manager.from_queryset(QuestionQuerySet)` is the long form —
  same result, useful when mixing into an existing Manager subclass.
-->

---

# Admin — `ModelAdmin` overrides

The admin's "register and forget" is the surface. Underneath, every part is a hook.

```python
@admin.register(Question)
class QuestionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display       = ("text", "owner", "pub_date")
    list_select_related = ("owner",)   # fix N+1 — one line

    def get_queryset(self, request):
        qs = super().get_queryset(request)
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            return qs
        return qs.filter(owner=request.user)   # row-level filtering, blessed

    def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
        if not change:                         # creation only
            obj.owner = request.user           # inject request context into the save
        super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)
```

<div class="mt-2 text-sm opacity-70">

Also: custom actions (<code>@admin.action</code>), <code>get_form</code>,
<code>formfield_for_foreignkey</code>, <code>readonly_fields</code>,
<code>inlines</code>, custom <code>AdminSite</code>.

</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:30
- The audience knows `list_display` and `inlines`. The point is to remind them
  that `get_queryset`, `save_model`, `get_form`, and custom actions are part of
  the same API surface and very cheap to override.
- `save_model` is the hook I reach for constantly — inject request context into
  every save. The same bend exists at the model layer via a `save()` override;
  if you do that, *always* call `super().save()`. Bugs from skipping it are
  still common.
-->

---

# Views & Forms — lifecycle hooks

CBVs and Forms are an inheritance API. Every named method is a planned hook.

```python
class QuestionListView(ListView):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().published()   # the custom QuerySet, reused

class QuestionCreateView(CreateView):
    form_class = QuestionForm

    def form_valid(self, form):                     # FormView-family hook
        form.instance.owner = self.request.user
        return super().form_valid(form)
```

```python
class QuestionForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, user=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        if user and not user.is_staff:           # dynamic choices per user
            self.fields["category"].queryset = Category.objects.public()
```

<div class="mt-2 text-sm opacity-70">

Also: <code>get_context_data</code>, <code>get_form_kwargs</code>, <code>dispatch</code> — and every mixin hook (<code>test_func</code>, …).

</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:15
- Senior audience: you've all done these. The point is that they are
  *the framework's API*, not workarounds.
- `form_valid` lives on the FormView family (`CreateView`/`UpdateView`) — hence
  the second class. It never fires on a plain `ListView`.
- The Form __init__ pattern in particular is officially supported and one of
  the cleanest places to inject runtime context.
-->

# Auth — custom backends

Authentication backends are a clean extension contract: implement
`authenticate()` + `get_user()`, register in settings.

```python
# accounts/backends.py
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.backends import ModelBackend

class EmailBackend(ModelBackend):
    def authenticate(self, request, username=None, password=None, **kwargs):
        User = get_user_model()
        try:
            user = User.objects.get(email__iexact=username)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None
        if user.check_password(password) and self.user_can_authenticate(user):
            return user
```

```python
# settings.py — stacked; Django tries them in order
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    "accounts.backends.EmailBackend",
    "django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend",
]
```

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:00
- Senior audience: most of you have done this for SSO/LDAP/SAML. Worth saying
  out loud that the backend API is *the* officially sanctioned deviation.

<p class="kicker"># when there's no hatch</p>

# Django, 2010

`auth.User` was **not swappable**. It had:

- `username` — required, max length 30
- `first_name`, `last_name` — anglocentric, blank-allowed
- `email` — not unique
- `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, `is_active`
- `password`, `last_login`, `date_joined`

That's it. No extension point, no `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting.

<div class="mt-6 opacity-80">

If you wanted login-by-email, or any extra field on the user, you had two
choices:

- a separate `Profile` model with a `OneToOneField` to `User` (ugly joins everywhere)
- **monkey-patch `User` directly**

</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 0:45
- Set the scene. The audience needs to feel the constraint before the hack
  becomes interesting.

<p class="kicker"># when there's no hatch, you make one</p>

# The `ravelsoft patchmodel` pattern (2010)

```python
# Adapted from ravelsoft.com/blog/2010/patchmodel-hacky-solution-extending-authuser-class
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class UserOverride:                       # old-style class — intentional
    email   = models.EmailField(_("e-mail"), unique=True)
    company = models.ForeignKey("Company", null=True)   # no on_delete — 2010!

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # custom pre-save logic
        self.save__overridden(*args, **kwargs)   # original save(), renamed

patch_model(User, UserOverride)
```

<v-clicks>

- Reaches into `User._meta.local_fields`, pops the original `email` field
- Re-adds the new one with the original's `creation_counter` (column order preserved)
- Replaces methods, keeps the original under `<name>__overridden`

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-4 text-sm opacity-70">

It was, in the author's own words, a <strong>hacky solution</strong>.
But it worked. And in 2010 it was what we had.

</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:30
- This is where it gets real for the senior part of the audience. Anyone who
  was writing Django before 2013 used some variant of this.
- "Old-style class" is a deliberate detail — Python 2 old-style class
  semantics; the patcher walks `__dict__` directly. Tell the audience why.
- Also period-accurate: no `on_delete`. It only arrived in Django 1.3 (2011)
  and only became required in 2.0. Mention it if anyone squints.
-->

# I used it. For everything.

<v-clicks>

- The obvious fields — a unique `email`, `company`, `locale`, `avatar`
- The convenience methods — `full_name()`, `can_see(obj)`, `colleagues_of()`
- And the big one: **row-level permissions on `User` and `Group`**

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-4">

```python
class UserPermsOverride:
    def has_row_perm(self, perm, obj):
        if self.is_superuser:
            return True
        ct = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(obj)
        return RowPermission.objects.filter(
            content_type=ct, object_id=obj.pk,
            permission__codename=perm,
        ).filter(Q(user=self) | Q(group__in=self.groups.all())).exists()

patch_model(User,  UserPermsOverride)
patch_model(Group, GroupPermsOverride)   # same idea, group-side
```

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4 opacity-80">
The Django convention was "permissions are per-model, not per-row."<br/>
My problem demanded per-row. The framework had no hatch. I made one.
</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:30
- Personal. This is where the audience trusts you because you're not selling
  the hack — you're telling them about the day the framework didn't fit.
- The shape of RowPermission (ContentType + object_id + permission, user OR
  group) is exactly what django-guardian later shipped. Good aside:
  "in hindsight, I had written a worse django-guardian."

#### The row-level perms patch

**Django still has no first-class row-level permissions** — in 2026.

- `django-rules` (predicate-based, no DB)
- DRF object-level permission classes

# When you do hack — leave a trail, set a watch

A hack in private is a trap for the next dev; a hack with no follow-up is a
debt that compounds silently.

<v-clicks>

- Document the **why**, in one obvious place — `accounts/backends.py`, not `utils.py`
- Surface it — README, onboarding doc, a lint rule if you can
- A `# TODO: drop this when Django ships X` comment is a contract with yourself
- Track the relevant Trac ticket, DEP, or third-party package — and the release notes
- Re-evaluate every major release — does the hatch finally exist?

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-5 opacity-80">

Rule of thumb: <strong>every deviation deserves a paper trail bigger than the change itself.</strong>

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-3 opacity-80">

In 2013 I had a one-line TODO on the `patch_model(User, ...)` line.<br/>
In 2014 I deleted that line. It paid for itself.

</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:15
- Practical. This is the slide where senior devs nod.
- "A TODO with a trigger condition is the cheapest form of project memory."
- The paper-trail line is deliberately a bit excessive. It should be.

- **New hires will ask about your deviation** — good. Write it down once, link forever. {.minus}
- **Stack Overflow won't help** the way it does for vanilla Django {.minus}

You're trading <strong>familiar friction</strong> for <strong>local friction</strong>.<br/>

Speaker notes — 1:00
- Honesty slide. Don't sell deviation as free.
- The LLM point lands hard in 2026 — every team has felt this. Pause on it.
- This is also a soft warning to junior devs in the room — "don't take this talk
  as a license to invent."

# Where I learned all this — slowly, painfully

<v-clicks>

- 2007–2013 — early Django, from **0.96** on: the `patchmodel` years
- 2013–onwards — the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` migration on a few real projects
- 2018–onwards — long-lived Django apps; the migration count climbs
- **2026** — 4.2 → 5.2 at **Boost Inc**: 10-year-old codebase, 4 PRs, **864 files**

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-6 opacity-80">

The Django framework's part of that 5.2 upgrade?<br/>
<strong>The smoothest part.</strong> The conventions still held — even the ones being questioned.

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4 text-sm opacity-70">

Backward compatibility is also a convention. Django keeps that one religiously.

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4 flex items-center gap-3">
  <img src="./images/boost-logo-green.png" class="h-8" alt="Boost Inc" />
  <span class="text-sm opacity-70">Thank you, Boost Inc, for backing my time here at EuroPython.</span>
</div>

<!--
Speaker notes — 1:00
- Small Boost Inc nod. Mention the upgrade briefly. Don't turn it into a
  retrospective talk — this is a side note.
- Story beats to riff on (pick ONE): of the 864 files, almost all were
  mechanical — the parts that fought back were pinned dependencies and
  tooling, not Django; the deprecation warnings had been announcing every
  break for two releases; the User model swap from 2013 sailed through
  untouched — three majors later.
- The "Django keeps backward compat religiously" line is a great way to close
  the section while still complimenting the framework.
- Land the thank-you: Boost paid for the time to be here. Short and warm.

# Takeaways

# Five things to take home

<v-clicks>

1. **Conventions are cached decisions.** They free your brain for the actual problem.

2. **Every Django default ships with an escape hatch.** Learn them; they're the senior-Django superpower.

3. **When the hatch doesn't exist, hacking is fine — with a paper trail and a watch.**

4. **Track the framework.** What was a hack in 2010 became a hatch in 2013 became a debate in 2024.

5. **Stay in the negotiation.** Django's conventions are good because people keep arguing about them — including you.

# I still love Django

<div class="mt-8 text-xl opacity-90">

After nearly two decades of using it — since 0.96 — patching it where it didn't fit,
swapping its user model when it finally let me, and watching the community
question even the path I migrated to —

I love this framework <em>more</em>, not less.

</div>

<div class="mt-8 opacity-80">

Good conventions are the ones you can <strong>respectfully disagree with</strong>
and still want to keep using.

</div>

<div class="mt-8 opacity-80">

Django passes that test.
